# Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning
Code for the paper: `Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning`[(Arxiv:1905.12926)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01076v3.pdf) for the text classification setup.
## Introduction
The ability to continuously learn and accumulate knowledge throughout a lifetime and reuse it effectively to adapt to a new problem quickly is a hallmark of general intelligence. State-of-the-art machine learning models work well on a single dataset given enough training examples, but they often fail to isolate and reuse previously acquired knowledge when the data distribution shifts (e.g., when presented with a new dataset)â€”a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting.In this paper, the authors  introduce a lifelong language learning setup where a model needs to learn from a stream of text examples without any dataset identifier. Specificaly, they propose an episodic memory model that performs sparse experience replay and local adaptation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in this setup. Experiments on the text classification and question answering tasks demonstrate that the episodic memory module is a crucial buildign block of general linguistic intelligence.

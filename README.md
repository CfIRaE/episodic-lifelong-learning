# Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning
Code for the paper: `Episodic Memory in Lifelong Language Learning`[(Arxiv:1905.12926)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01076v3.pdf) for the text classification setup.
## Introduction
The ability to continuously learn and accumulate knowledge throughout a lifetime and reuse it effectively to adapt to a new problem quickly is a hallmark of general intelligence.State-of-the-art machine learning models work well on a single dataset given enough training examples, but they often fail to isolate and reuse previously acquired knowledge when the data distribution shifts (e.g., when presented with a new dataset)â€”a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting.In this paper, the authors introduce a lifelong learning setup to take a step closer to learning a general linguistic intelligence.Specificaly, they propose an episodic memory model that performs sparse experience replay and local adaptation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in this setup.
